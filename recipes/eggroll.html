    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>50g dried mung bean noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound of ground pork</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots</li>
        <li>1/3 cup rehydrated wood ear mushrooms </li>
        <li>1/4 cup of shallots</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger</li>
        <li>1 egg white </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegietable oil </li>
        <li>salt & pepper</li>
        <li>warm water</li>
        <li>20 dried rice paper wrappers</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried mung bean noodles in warm water (submerge them completely) for 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly, and cut into ¼ inch pieces. </li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the noodles, ground pork, grated carrot, chopped wood ear mushrooms, shallots, garlic, ginger egg white, fish sauce, vegetable oil, salt, white pepper, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Mix until everything is uniformly combined. </li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large, shallow bowl or deep plate, dissolve the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in 1 cup warm water. Sugar is optional but does help the spring rolls to brown when frying.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To wrap each roll, place a rice paper wrapper into the sugar water for about 5-10 seconds, making sure it is completely submerged. Remove it from the water. It will still be quite firm, but it will soften quickly! </li>
        <br>
        <li>Place about 40g of filling in a log shape on one side of the wrapper. Begin tightly folding the wrapper over the filling (no air bubbles!), and roll the spring roll forward 1 complete revolution. Lightly press down on each end of the filling to flatten the rice paper and push the filling together to eliminate any air bubbles. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Fold the wrapper for the rolls and set on plate.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Frying Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <br>
        <li>Heat about 3 cups of canola or vegetable oil in a medium pot to 335°F/170°C (the oil level should be a little over halfway up the sides). Fry the spring rolls in small batches—about three at a time. Make sure they do not touch just after they are placed in the oil as the skins will be sticky until a crust forms. Cook each batch for 5 to 6 minutes, or until light golden brown. (Frying them in small batches prevents them from sticking to each other.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use a metal slotted spoon to pull them out of the oil. Drain on a rack, and continue frying. Maintain the correct oil temperature by periodically adjusting your heat. </li>
        <br>
        <li>When ready to serve, refry the spring rolls (yes, they need to be fried twice) at 350°F/175°C for 1 ½ to 2 minutes to make them nice and crispy. Double-frying is important! Serve with fresh lettuce, cilantro, Thai basil, mint and nuoc cham for dipping.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let Cool and EAT!!!!</li>
